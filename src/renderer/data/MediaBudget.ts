/**
 * System-wide budget for "live" decoded media elements.
 *
 * Chromium keeps decoded bitmaps of images/videos alive as long as a live
 * HTMLImageElement/HTMLVideoElement still references them (memory_cache.cc /
 * image_loader.cc research). The old architecture capped history/per-player
 * independently, so a grid of N ImagePlayers could hold N × (history+ready)
 * decoded images at once — the multi-GB RAM climb.
 *
 * This module tracks every live player instance and caps the TOTAL number of
 * media elements currently held across all of them. Each player's effective
 * history cap is derived from the shared budget so no single player (or the
 * grid as a whole) can exceed it.
